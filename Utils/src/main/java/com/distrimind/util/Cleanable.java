/**
 *
 * This API aims to prevent future deactivation of finalize method calling by the garbage collector.
 * It uses Cleanable java API when JVM version is greater than Java 8.
 * Otherwise, it uses standard finalize method.
 *
 * To replace finalize method, your "finalizable" class must inherit this class.
 * Then, a constructor must call the method {@link #registerCleaner(Cleaner)} with a cleaner that
 * inherit the class {@link Cleaner}, and that must implement the method {@link Cleaner#performCleanup()}
 *
 * If you do not call the method {@link #clean()}, then the garbage collector will call it for you
 * when the object becomes unreferenced. If the JVM version is upper to Java 8, then, the Java Cleaner API is used.
 * Otherwise, it is the classical finalize method that is used.
 *
 * Please do not override method {@link #finalize()}. Otherwise, this API will be obsolete.
